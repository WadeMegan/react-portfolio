## Summary 

Best Brand For is a web application that allows users to make requests for products they are looking to purchase. Other users can then comment on the request to recommend their favorite brands for that product. For example, if a user is looking to buy a pair of running shoes, they can make a request for "Running Shoes" and other users might comment "Nike", "Adidas", etc. The goal of Best Brand For is to make it easy for users to make better buying decisions with the help of other users' experience.
